## Description
The WHR is an annual report published by the "Sustainable Development Network" at the United Nations. Its aim is to determine which socio-economic factors lead to happiness, and to promote the belief that happiness should be prioritized over economic growth.
Gallup polls over 1000 representative citizens per country annually from almost every country on how happy they are with their life on a scale of 1 to 10. This dataset covers 9 years (2015-2023).
They are also asked how if they have someone they can count on (social support), if they have donated money recently (generosity), if they have freedom (freedom to make life choices), and if they see their country as corrupt (perceptions of corruption). These data, along with GDP per capita and life expectancy, are used to try to understand what leads to happiness. 


## Objectives
To showcase dashboard to showcase results from an exploratory analysis of a dataset using regression and cluster analysis with Python.



## Data
“World Happiness Report up to 2023”. The Kaggle set has collated results for 9 years, from 2015 to 2023.

## Recommendations
After analyzing the World Happiness Report dataset using Jupyter Notebooks to run Python and Pandas, we constructed a dashboard in Tableau with our recommendations.
